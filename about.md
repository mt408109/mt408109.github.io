# About Me
Hello! I am [MT].
My top current career choice is a metallurgist because of science and technology. It appeals to me because I have an interest in science. This career connects to my lifestyle goals allowing me to do the stuff I like to do and will support the things I want. The skills from this course will help me in the future like Software proficiency, research & development, critical thinking.
